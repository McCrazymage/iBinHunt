Programs in the preprocess directory are used to create the input files to the bindiff program.
You must do the following:

(1) ./convert <input_idadb_1>
(2) ./convert <input_idadb_2>
(3) ./fromDG <DarunGrim sqlite output database


convert expects an IDAPro database (exported using the VinE plugin) as input.  It creates the output file ir__<inputfilename>.  This is a file containing the VinE IR of a particular binary and will be used as input to bindiff.

fromDG expects an sqlite database (created from the DarunGrim syntactic difference finder) as input.  It creates two files: fun_matchings__<inputfilename> and block_matchings__<inputfilename>.  These files, respectively, contains the syntactic function and block matching information.  They are used as input to bindiff.
